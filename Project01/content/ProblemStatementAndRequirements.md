# Problem Statement and System Requirements

## Problem Statement

Corruption is a pervasive issue that affects many sectors of society. It can take many forms and involves a wide range of actors, making it a complex problem to analyze. Traditional methods of analyzing corruption cases often fall short, as they struggle to handle the complexity and diversity of these cases. There is a need for a more robust and flexible system that can store, manage, and analyze a wide range of information about corruption cases.

## System Requirements

The system should be able to handle the following requirements:

1. **Data Storage:** The system should be able to store a wide range of information about corruption cases, including details about the individuals and organizations involved, the nature of the corruption, the consequences of the corruption, and any other relevant information.

2. **Data Analysis:** The system should provide a range of analysis tools and techniques, including network analysis techniques and statistical methods. These tools should be able to handle the complexity and diversity of corruption cases, and should be able to identify patterns and trends in the data.

3. **User Interface:** The system should provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily interact with the system and visualize the results of the analysis. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use, even for users with little technical expertise.

4. **Scalability:** The system should be scalable, able to handle a large number of corruption cases without a significant loss of performance.

5. **Security:** The system should ensure the security and privacy of the data, with appropriate measures in place to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.

## User Requirements

The users of the system are likely to be researchers, policymakers, and others interested in understanding and combating corruption. Their requirements may include:

1. **Ease of Use:** Users should be able to easily interact with the system and understand the results of the analysis.

2. **Flexibility:** Users should be able to customize the analysis to suit their specific needs and interests.

3. **Insightfulness:** The system should provide insightful and meaningful results that help users to better understand the structure and dynamics of corruption networks.

4. **Reliability:** Users should be able to rely on the system to provide accurate and reliable results.

5. **Support:** Users should have access to support and guidance in using the system and interpreting the results.
