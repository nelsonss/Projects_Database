# Data Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the data Implementation for the CrimeScope Analytics Platform. The model is designed to capture the intricacies of crime data while allowing for comprehensive analysis and reporting. The schema has been implemented in PostgreSQL, and the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to define the structure of the database.

## Schema Definition
The following is the SQL DDL for creating the necessary tables in our PostgreSQL database. The tables are created in a sequence that respects the dependencies between them, ensuring that foreign key relationships are maintained and that the integrity of the data model is preserved.

```sql
-- Create Country table
CREATE TABLE Country (
    CountryID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Create State table
CREATE TABLE State (
    StateID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CountryID INT REFERENCES Country(CountryID)
);

-- Create City table
CREATE TABLE City (
    CityID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    StateID INT REFERENCES State(StateID)
);
